# From Claude User to Claude Power User in 30 Seconds

Yesterday: *"Please analyze this messaging for customer focus, apply the B.E.S.T. framework, identify pain points, transform the copy..."* (every. single. time.)

Today: `/message review the homepage`

Tomorrow: Your own command library that makes your team wonder how you work so fast.

## Stop Repeating Yourself in Claude Code

Tired of typing the same complex prompts every day? Frustrated when Claude doesn't quite understand your specific workflow? You're not alone. 

This command library lets you teach Claude YOUR way of working - once. Then just call your custom commands whenever you need them.

## What You Get

- **Instant Commands**: Transform multi-paragraph prompts into simple `/commands`
- **Your Workflow, Automated**: Make Claude work exactly how your brain works
- **Battle-Tested Library**: Access commands created by developers who solved the same problems
- **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can type `/help`, you can use this

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/Liviofrol/commands
```

That's it. Now type `/help` in Claude Code to see your new superpowers.

## Your New Superpowers

### `/issues` - Turn Ideas into Perfect GitHub Issues in Seconds
Stop wasting 15 minutes formatting GitHub issues. Describe what you want in plain English, and watch Claude create a perfectly structured issue that follows your project's conventions, includes acceptance criteria, and even adds the right labels. 

**Before**: "I need to add dark mode... let me write up the issue... what's the template again?"  
**After**: `/issues add dark mode toggle to settings`  
**Result**: Professional GitHub issue created with proper formatting, labels, and context

### `/work` - From Issue to Implementation Plan in One Command
That daunting GitHub issue? Claude reads it, analyzes your entire codebase, creates a feature branch, and builds a comprehensive implementation plan complete with edge cases, test strategies, and security considerations. You review the plan, approve, and start coding with confidence.

**Before**: Stare at issue → Browse codebase for 30 minutes → Wonder where to start  
**After**: `/work #47`  
**Result**: Branch created, todo list ready, implementation strategy clear

### `/message` - Transform Any Copy into Customer-Focused Gold
Stop writing feature lists that nobody reads. Transform your product descriptions, README files, or marketing copy using the B.E.S.T. framework. Make customers the hero of their story, not a spectator to yours.

**Before**: "Our tool provides enterprise-grade scalability and robust API integration..."  
**After**: `/message review our homepage copy`  
**Result**: "Stop your servers from crashing during Black Friday. Handle 10x traffic without breaking a sweat."
